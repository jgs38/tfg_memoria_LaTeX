    abstract={While the selection of strongly lensed galaxies (SLGs) with 500 μm flux density S 500 > 100 mJy has proven to be rather straightforward, for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the ones obtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. Moreover, only by probing to fainter flux densities is it possible to exploit strong lensing to investigate the bulk of the high- z star-forming galaxy population. We describe HALOS (the Herschel -ATLAS Lensed Objects Selection), a method for efficiently selecting fainter candidate SLGs, reaching a surface density of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 1.5-2 deg –2 , i.e., a factor of about 4-6 higher than that at the 100 mJy flux limit. HALOS will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidate SLGs (with amplifications μ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 2) over the full H-ATLAS survey area. Applying HALOS to the H-ATLAS Science Demonstration Phase field ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 14.4 deg 2 ) we find 31 candidate SLGs, whose candidate lenses are identified in the VIKING near-infrared catalog. Using the available information on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 72\% purity of the sample. As expected, the purity decreases with decreasing flux density of the sources and with increasing angular separation between candidate sources and lenses. The redshift distribution of the candidate lensed sources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensed galaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to redshifts substantially higher than found in the other surveys. The counts of candidate SLGs are also in good agreement with model predictions. Even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infrared VIKING photometry, we show that H-ATLAS data alone allow the selection of a similarly deep sample of candidate SLGs with an efficiency close to 50\%; a slightly lower surface density ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 1.45 deg –2 ) can be reached with a ~70\% efficiency.}

We find that the evolution of the comoving LF is strong up to z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. From the LFs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis, we derived an average relation between SFR and halo mass (and its scatter). We also infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded star formation in massive halos ( M H ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 3 × 10 12 M ☉ ) amounts to ~7 × 10 8 yr. Given the SFRs, which are in the range of 10 2 -10 3 M ☉ yr –1 , this timescale implies final stellar masses of the order of 10 11 -10 12 M ☉ . The corresponding stellar mass function matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 1. The comparison of the statistics for submillimeter and UV-selected galaxies suggests that the dust-free, UV bright phase is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 10 2 times shorter than the submillimeter bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset of star formation. Using a single reference spectral energy distribution (SED; the one of the z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 2.3 galaxy SMM J2135-0102), our simple physical model is able to reproduce not only the LFs at different redshifts >1 but also the counts at wavelengths ranging from 250 μm to ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 1 mm. Owing to the steepness of the counts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests that the dispersion of submillimeter SEDs of z > 1 galaxies around the reference one is rather small.}

 abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

  abstract={I discuss a novel approach to identifying cosmic events in separate and independent observations. The focus is on the true events, such as supernova explosions, that happen once and, hence, whose measurements are not repeatable. Their classification and analysis must make the best use of all available data. Bayesian hypothesis testing is used to associate streams of events in space and time. Probabilities are assigned to the matches by studying their rates of occurrence. A case study of Type Ia supernovae illustrates how to use light curves in the cross-identification process. Constraints from realistic light curves happen to be well approximated by Gaussians in time, which makes the matching process very efficient. Model-dependent associations are computationally more demanding but can further boost one's confidence.}

abstract={Massive galaxies in the early Universe have been shown to be forming stars at surprisingly high rates. Prominent examples are dust obscured galaxies which are luminous when observed at sub millimeter (sub-mm) wavelengths and which may be forming stars at a rate of 1,000 solar masses per year.These intense bursts of star formation are believed to be driven by mergers between gas rich galaxies. However, probing  the properties of  individual star forming regions within these galaxies is beyond the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the largest telescopes at present.Here, we report observations of the sub-mm galaxy SMMJ2135-0102 at redshift z=2.3259 which has been gravitationally magnified by a factor of 32 by a massive foreground galaxy cluster lens.This cosmic magnification, when combined with high-resolution sub-mm imaging,resolves the star-forming regions at a linear scale of just. 100 parsecs. We find that the luminosity densities of these star-forming regions are comparable to the dense cores of giant molecular  clouds in  the  local Universe, but they are 100 larger and 107 times more luminous. Although vigorously star-forming, the  underlying  physics of the star formation processes at z=2 appears to be similar to that seen in local galaxies even though the energetics are unlike anything found in the present-day Universe.}

        abstract = {This paper is the second in a pair of articles presenting data release 1 (DR1) of the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS), the largest single open-time key project carried out with the Herschel Space Observatory. The H-ATLAS is a wide-area imaging survey carried out in five photometric bands at 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500\${$\backslash$}mu\$m covering a total area of 600deg\${\^{ }}2\$. In this paper we describe the identification of optical counterparts to submillimetre sources in DR1, comprising an area of 161 deg\${\^{ }}2\$ over three equatorial fields of roughly 12\${\^{ }}{$\backslash$}circ\$x4.5\${\^{ }}{$\backslash$}circ\$ centred at 9\${\^{ }}h\$, 12\${\^{ }}h\$ and 14.5\${\^{ }}h\$ respectively. Of all the H-ATLAS fields, the equatorial regions benefit from the greatest overlap with current multi-wavelength surveys spanning ultraviolet (UV) to mid-infrared regimes, as well as extensive spectroscopic coverage. We use a likelihood-ratio technique to identify SDSS counterparts at r{\ensuremath{<}}22.4 for 250-\${$\backslash$}mu\$m-selected sources detected at \${$\backslash$}geq\$ 4\${$\backslash$}sigma\$ (\${$\backslash$}approx\$28mJy). We find `reliable' counterparts (reliability R\${$\backslash$}geq\$0.8) for 44,835 sources (39 per cent), with an estimated completeness of 73.0 per cent and contamination rate of 4.7 per cent. Using redshifts and multi-wavelength photometry from GAMA and other public catalogues, we show that H-ATLAS-selected galaxies at \$z{\ensuremath{<}}0.5\$ span a wide range of optical colours, total infrared (IR) luminosities, and IR/UV ratios, with no strong disposition towards mid-IR-classified AGN in comparison with optical selection. The data described herein, together with all maps and catalogues described in the companion paper (Valiante et al. 2016), are available from the H-ATLAS website at www.h-atlas.org.}

  abstract={We introduce ANN z , a freely available software package for photometric redshift estimation using artificial neural networks. ANN z learns the relation between photometry and redshift from an appropriate training set of galaxies for which the redshift is already known. Where a large and representative training set is available, ANN z is a highly competitive tool when compared with traditional template‐fitting methods. The ANN z package is demonstrated on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 1, and for this particular data set the rms redshift error in the range 0≲z≲0.7 is σ rms = 0.023. Nonideal conditions (spectroscopic sets that are small or brighter than the photometric set for which redshifts are required) are simulated, and the impact on the photometric redshift accuracy is assessed.2}
